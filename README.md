# pipedrive_API_to_spreadsheet
*A little system that uses Pipedrive's API to get all deals by products and save them as a excel file.*

Hello Everyone!
 
I'm very new to this wolrd of coding, but since I found it, I fell in love haha.
So, this is my first project that I made for Grecon America Latina as an intern and even being a little simple, I'm very proud of it!

through this project I've learned the concepts of API callings, manipulating JSON data, reading/writing nested arrays and how to use libraries and plugins in a code.
  
What's the point of this project you may ask. Its simply:
  
1. Read all the products that some company have and generate a select box with these products to the user.
2. After selecting a product, the user will be redirected to a page where, with an API call, get all deals from that product and organize them as a matrix.
3. As a matrix, the Datatables plugin will print it on the screen as a table, with the option to download it as Excel! That's it!
